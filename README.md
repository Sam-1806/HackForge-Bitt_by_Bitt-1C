We have created a Main folder in which we have added the complete source code for our application.

To run the project, open the 'Main' Folder in Visual Studio Code, then search for 'index.html' file, and open it with live server.

If any doubts/problems, feel free to contact! (+91 8767383170 --Tejas Mankeshwar)

NOTE: As we are implementing the Google Earth interface using the API call, we can't commit the Google Earth feature due to security reasons, but we have         uploaded a .kml file which can be opened in Google Earth and shows the locations of the NGOs accurately.
      Along with that, we have implemented a guide through chatbot which is hosted locally right now. So I can provide the access whenever needed and we          shall soon deploy it on the huggingface server. But till then kindly contact us to gain the access of the Chatbot.
